	TLB (translation lookeside buffer) - buffer for caching indexes 
after translation pages from virtual memory to physical memory
// Get page from cache ~60 times faster then calculate throw tables

	SSE (Streming SIMD Extentions or Vectorization) - extention
for CPU (for work with floating points)
// already exist mmx (multi-media extention)

__asm { // cpecific code ... };

	Degree of connectivity:
1) friend relation (C++ only)
2) inheriance
3) composition // class A { B instance_; }; don't exist separately
4) agregation // class A { B * ptr_;  }; exist separately
